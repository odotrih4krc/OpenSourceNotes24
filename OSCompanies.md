# Arduino - Somerville, Somerville, MA 

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that consists of both hardware and software components. It was founded in 2005 by a group of five co-founders: Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis.

The concept of Arduino originated at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Ivrea, Italy. Massimo Banzi, one of the co-founders, was a teacher at IDII, where he aimed to create a simple and affordable platform for his students to learn about electronics and programming.

Banzi, along with the other co-founders, started developing a prototyping platform that would be easy to use, flexible, and accessible to beginners and non-technical individuals. They wanted to create a tool that would enable people to quickly build interactive projects without requiring a deep understanding of electronics.

The team named their platform Arduino, inspired by a bar in Ivrea that they used to frequent. The name Arduino comes from "Bar di Re Arduino," which means "Bar of King Arduino" in Italian.

The first Arduino board, known as the Arduino Diecimila, was released in 2005. It featured an Atmel microcontroller, a USB interface for programming and communication, and a simple integrated development environment (IDE) that made it easy to write and upload code.

Arduino gained popularity rapidly due to its user-friendly design, open-source nature, and active community support. The availability of schematics, software libraries, and example projects allowed users to quickly get started and create a wide range of projects.

The success and growth of Arduino led to the establishment of Arduino LLC in 2009, which continued to develop and support the platform. The company has since released several iterations of Arduino boards with enhanced features and capabilities.

Today, Arduino has become one of the most widely used platforms for prototyping and creating interactive projects. It has a vast community of users, makers, educators, and professionals who contribute to its ecosystem by sharing projects, tutorials, and libraries.

# Raspberry Pi- Cambridge, England

Raspberry Pi is a series of small, affordable single-board computers that are popular for educational, hobbyist, and DIY projects. It was founded by Eben Upton, Rob Mullins, Jack Lang, Alan Mycroft, and Pete Lomas, who were all involved with the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory.

The idea for Raspberry Pi originated in 2006 when Eben Upton, who was working as a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, noticed a decline in the number of students applying to study computer science. Upton and his colleagues believed that the lack of affordable and accessible computers for learning and experimentation was a contributing factor.

They envisioned a low-cost, credit card-sized computer that could be used to teach programming and computer science concepts. The goal was to create a device that was powerful enough to run real-world applications while being affordable and flexible.

In 2008, the team formed the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the study of computer science and related topics. Their primary aim was to develop and distribute the Raspberry Pi computer as an educational tool.

The first Raspberry Pi prototype was developed in 2009, and after several iterations and refinements, the Raspberry Pi Model B was released in February 2012. It featured a Broadcom system-on-a-chip (SoC), an ARM processor, graphics capabilities, USB ports, an Ethernet port, and an HDMI output.

The Raspberry Pi gained immediate attention and popularity, surpassing the initial educational focus to become widely adopted by hobbyists, tinkerers, and professionals for a variety of projects. Its affordability, versatility, and the support of a vibrant community contributed to its success.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation continued to release newer models with improved specifications and features, addressing the needs and feedback of users. They also provided software support, documentation, and educational resources to help users get started and explore the possibilities of the platform.
